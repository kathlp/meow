          <h2>Justice for Killua</h2><br><br>
          <p>PAWS condemns the brutal killing of a dog named Killua in Camarines Sur, emphasizing that there were 
            no elements of self-defense present. They stress the importance of humane animal control methods and 
            the need to file criminal cases against offenders. With affidavits from witnesses, PAWS will pursue 
            charges under the Animal Welfare Act. They urge witnesses of similar crimes to come forward and cooperate 
            with law enforcement. PAWS emphasizes the collective duty to protect animals and urges swift action to 
            end impunity for animal offenders.

          <h2>Puppy-Killer Security Guard</h2><br><br>
          <p>PAWS filed a criminal complaint against Jojo Malicdem, a security guard accused of throwing a puppy from 
            an elevated footbridge near SM City North Edsa, resulting in its death. Janine Santos, a witness whose viral 
            post alerted the public, contradicted Malicdem's statement, affirming that she saw him forcefully throw the 
            puppy over the railing. PAWS stressed the importance of holding animal offenders accountable, citing the 
            correlation between animal cruelty and violence against humans. They thanked those who spoke up and emphasized 
            the collective commitment to creating a humane society. Updates on the case will be provided by PAWS in the coming weeks.

          <h2>Father's Love</h2><br><br>
          <p>Tatay Dionisio, a sidewalk dweller in Manila, faces financial struggles while caring for his family and sick dog, Lea. 
            During a nearby medical mission, Lea receives treatment from Doc Candice, including spaying to prevent future issues. 
            Despite embarrassment for being unable to pay, Tatay expresses gratitude. The medical team reassures him, seeing their 
            assistance as a gift for caring for Lea despite their hardships. Follow-up treatment for Lea and other street pets is 
            planned, with donations requested to support these efforts. Financial and in-kind contributions are welcomed to continue 
            the medical mission's work.

            <h2>Justice for Ungasis</h2><br><br>
            <p>In January 2023, Jojo De Vera Garillo allegedly hit a dog named Ungasis with a piece of wood, causing severe 
            injuries including lacerations to the eye, a swollen mandible, and damage to the spine. PAWS and the owner filed 
            a case under The Animal Welfare Act, leading to the public prosecutor finding probable cause for Garillo to stand trial. 
            Today, on November 16, 2023, PAWS is present at the Malabon MTC for Garilloâ€™s arraignment. Despite surviving, 
            Ungasis bears physical scars including a permanent limp, while emotional trauma remains. PAWS urges the public 
            to speak out against animal cruelty and provide affidavits to support legal actions. They offer free legal assistance 
            and appreciate any support for attending court hearings through donations via GCASH or bank accounts provided on their website.

          <h2>Fritos Forever Home</h2><br><br>
          <p>Veterinarian Kim Occidental-Diaz, while working part-time at PAWS, decides to adopt another rescued animal for her 
            home in Laguna after adopting a tripod cat named Alab. Despite having over 200 animals to choose from, she develops a 
            connection with a puspin named Frito, who eagerly greets her during her rounds. Frito's sweet and friendly personality 
            convinces Kim to bring him to his forever home. Adopting from PAWS not only saves the life of an animal rescued from 
            cruelty but also opens up space in the shelter for more rescues. For adoption, fostering, volunteering, or donation 
            inquiries, visit www.paws.org.ph.

          <h2>Dolores, The rescued aspin from Boracay</h2><br><br>
          <p>In 2019, a poor aspin named Dolores was found hiding and slowly dying on Boracay Island after 
            being severely abused for attempting to steal food. Rescued by @aarrc_philippines, Dolores was 
            flown to PAWS in Manila where she found her forever home with the Tan family. Today, Dolores 
            and her family happily support #NationalAspinDay2023, attending PAWS events regularly. 
            Now weighing a healthy 25kg, Dolores is described as affectionate and loving by her fur dad. 
            The Tan family's decision to see #BeautyBeyondBreed and provide Dolores with love and care is 
            commended by PAWS. PAWS hopes for more rescued and abused animals like Dolores to find safe 
            and loving homes. Adopting a dog from PAWS costs only P1,000 (P500 for cats), offering a 
            meaningful decision for both adopter and animal. Visit www.paws.org.ph for adoption details.
