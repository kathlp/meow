          <h2>Donate your GLOBE Rewards Points</h2>
          <p> Hurry! Globe Rewards Points accumulated last year are going to expire on March 31, 2024. To make the most of them, you may choose to donate to PAWS and help animals in need.
            Donations from Globe Rewards directly fund our Spay and Neuter projects, such as our medical missions and free kapon outreach for indigent pet owners. Spaying an animal can save hundreds of cats and dogs from abandonment or being born on the streets as strays, ending up in the pound.

            <p>They may not have won the top prizes but the judges had a heck of a time cutting them out of the Cutest, Most Creative , Most Original, Strongest Stage Presence awards. 
                Take a bow, creative pet parents. Your efforts did not go to waste: these costumes surely brought a huge smile to everyone‚Äôs faces and helped raise funds for the PAWS shelter. 
                Congratulations to you and to all those who helped make SCAD a howling success!

            <h2>World Spay Day</h2>
            <p>Our Kapon Team was able to finish all the surgeries last night by 8 in the evening, bringing us to a total of 433 animals fixed for FREE.
                It may have been a very long wait for our recipients, but it was surely worth it, as their pets will not be multiplying from now on and will live happier and healthier lives.
                We are also very proud of our team PAWSxVIP for working the long, grueling hours to ensure that all animals will be accommodated for kapon.
                We are an organization not funded by the government, and we are only able to conduct these projects with the help of your donations. Please support our kapon efforts by donating through Gcash Bills or visit paws.org.ph/donate.
