          <h2>Legislative Advocacy:</h2>
          <p>PAWS has a long and successful history of lobbying for stronger animal protection laws. Their most significant achievement was playing a critical role in the creation of Republic Act 8485, also known as the Animal Welfare Act of 1998. This landmark legislation established important legal protections for animals in the Philippines, prohibiting cruelty, neglect, and abandonment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
          <h2>Policy Reform:</h2>
          <p>PAWS doesn't stop at national legislation. They also work to influence local government policies related to animal control, shelter operations, and responsible pet ownership practices. By advocating for humane treatment at the local level, PAWS helps create a more comprehensive animal welfare framework throughout the Philippines.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
          <h2>Public Awareness Campaigns: </h2>
          <p> Shifting cultural attitudes is key to achieving lasting change. PAWS runs public awareness campaigns that educate the public about animal welfare issues, responsible pet ownership, and the importance of spaying and neutering pets. Through campaigns and partnerships with media outlets, PAWS works to foster a national conversation about animal rights and encourage Filipinos to become compassionate pet owners.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h2>Collaboration and Partnerships:</h2>
            <p>PAWS recognizes the power of collaboration. They work alongside other animal welfare organizations, government agencies, and law enforcement to advocate for better treatment of animals. This collaborative approach strengthens their voice and allows them to tackle complex issues more effectively.</p>
